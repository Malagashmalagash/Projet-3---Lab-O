Lab'O project
========================

The Lab'O project is a web application for the management of equipment loans and their return. The application
can collect the loan details and the signature and agree on a date of return of the equipment. After a restitution, the 
summary of the loan remains stored in archive for a period of three months before being deleted
automatically. If the date of return is not respected, an automatic email is sent after a period of
24h, every day until the return of the equipment.  

The application's developpers : Anthony Sottejeau, Cl√©ment Paquin, Julia Limousin, Anthony Pointu, Quentin Picart.
